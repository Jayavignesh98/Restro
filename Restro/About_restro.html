    <h2>ABOUT US</h2><br>
    <p>j'Restro’s opened on Thanksgiving Day 1990. Chef / Owner Ron Silver began baking pies and selling them to restaurants and his neighbors out of a small kitchen at the corner of Hudson and North Moore St. in Tribeca. Today, NYC’s beloved restaurant and pie shop celebrates 33 years of classic, made from scratch Indian cooking.</p>
